    <h3>Beta Release Notice</h3>
    <p>
      Thanks for your interest in The Odin Project and we're excited to have you in on the ground floor! Just so you know, this is currently a beta-level product, which means a couple of things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>It's Rough Around the Edges</strong><br> This is a pre-release, so please don't expect perfection.  It's very much a work in progress that responds to your needs and we'll be expanding the features based on the feedback we receive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>We Need Your Help!</strong><br> Use the suggestion box at the bottom of the screen or email us at feedback@theodinproject.com with any feedback.  If you want to get involve (it's open source!), check out our Contributing page.  We're all building this project together!
